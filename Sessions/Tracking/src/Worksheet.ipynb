The cost matrix will have a **row** for each point in the current frame and a **column** for each available track.  The value of each element will therefore be the cost of linking the point and track corresponding to that row and column.  We also want to limit the distance that links can be made over; therefore, any point-track pairs separations that are greater than a specific distance will be set to **infinity**.  This doesn't prevent them being linked (if there are no better options, the assignment algorithm will still suggest that as a link), but it makes it less likely."

Rather than create our own implementation of this, we will use SciPy's linear_sum_assignment function.  This algorithm simply takes the cost matrix we just created and outputs a 1D **list** of the assignments.  Each element of this list corresponds to a **row** (**i.e. current point**) in the cost matrix, while the value of that element corresponds to the assigned **column** (**i.e. track**).  We use this list of assignments to assign the current points the correct track ID.  As mentioned previously, the Munkres algorithm will still assign links that we set to **infinity**, so before we copy over any track IDs we want to double check the cost is not **infinity**."
