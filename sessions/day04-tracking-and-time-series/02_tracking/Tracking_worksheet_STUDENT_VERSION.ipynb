    "## Exercise 6 - Calculate cost matrix\n",
    "Now we can calculate the cost for a single pair of points we need to do it for all point pairs.  We will create a function which takes the points in the current frame and the available track points, then generates a 2D cost matrix.  The cost matrix will have a column for each point in the current frame and a row for each available track.  The value of each element will therefore be the cost of linking the point and track corresponding to that column and row.  We also want to limit the distance that links can be made over; therefore, any point-track pairs separations that are greater than a specific distance will be set to infinity.  This doesn't prevent them being linked (if there are no better options, the assignment algorithm will still suggest that as a link), but it makes it less likely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have the cost matrix, we can use SciPy's linear_sum_assignment to calculate the optimal assignments.  This step has been included as the final step in the test space.  We will look into the format of the assignment output in more detail as part of exercise 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aims\n",
    "- Given two lists containing row indices, the first for the most recent instance of all available tracks and the second for all points in the current frame, calculate a cost matrix.\n",
    "- Arguments: The coordinates dataframe, the row indices for tracks, row indices for current points, a distance threshold\n",
    "- Return: An array of floating point values corresponding to the costs for linking all points\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "- The cost matrix will need to be a 2D Numpy array with a row for every available track and a column for every point in the current frame.\n",
    "- One way to do this is to use nested loops.  \"Nesting loops\" simply means to put one loop inside another.  The following example has two nested loops, which print their iteration numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "    for i in range(0,3):\n",
    "        for j in range(7,9):\n",
    "            print(i,\",\",j)\n",
    "``` \n",
    "        This will print the following: \"0,7\", \"0,8\", \"1,7\", \"1,8\", \"2,7\", \"2,8\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "- When looping over a structure you can use the *enumerate* function get the current iteration index as well as the current value:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "    demo_array = np.array([42,63,21])\n",
    "    for i,val in enumerate(demo_array):\n",
    "        print(\"Iter=%i,value=%i\" % (i,val))\n",
    "```\n",
    "        This will print \"Iter=0,value=42\", \"Iter=1,value=63\", \"Iter=2,value=21\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- So we can easily see how this is working, we'll load a special set of coordinates.  This set only has 3 points in the first frame and 4 points in the second frame."
