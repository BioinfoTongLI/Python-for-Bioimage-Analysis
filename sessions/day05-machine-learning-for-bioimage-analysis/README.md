## Machine Learning:

This course is composed of 6 lectures and number of practical tasks in Python.

The content is heavily based on materials by [Toby Breckon](http://breckon.eu/toby/teaching/mltutorial/) and [Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/).

Sessions:
1. Basic Predictive Models
2. Image Features
3. Unsupervised Learning
4. Supervised Learning
5. Deep Learning

Additionally there are four tasks corresponding to the Sessions 1, 3 and 4. To perform those download `simple_blobs.zip` from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0s1mo71j99p1di3/AACscxEOM1mXnGhIZICCoMMDa?dl=0) and unzip in `assets` directory.

Prepared and presented by [Mikolaj (Miks) Kundegorski](https://mixmixmix.github.io) with help from [Chas Nelson](https://chasnelson.co.uk) for Python For Bioimage Analysis Course in Cambridge, December 2019.
